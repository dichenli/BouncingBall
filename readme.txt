Assignment 8 

By Dichen Li and Rajveer Parikh

Game name: Goal Keeper

Objective: score as many as possible to the opposite's goal, and keep your own goal.

Description: You as the keeper on the bottom, can only move within penalty area shown in white lines, and can bounce back the white balls moving towards you, so is your opponent keeper! There are 5 balls in total in a game, and the game is 1 minute in length. Game is over whenever all balls goal or time runs out.

Future improvements we could make: 
We could allow white balls to bounce back each other.
Allow free movement of keepers across field (need to consider the interaction between keepers, and them against balls simultaneously!)
Add players on the field (like foosball)
Improve AI
Improve collision model to make it more physical.
